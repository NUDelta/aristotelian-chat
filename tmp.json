     "name": "trying to have better communication with my child who is out of state in college",
     "summary": "For you, trying to have better communication with your college-aged child who is out of state is deeply intertwined with the desire to ensure her well-being, success, and happiness. Moments when you don't receive prompt responses can be challenging, as they trigger concerns about her safety and academic struggles. Despite these worries, your approach is filled with thoughtfulness, as seen in the way you send articles, vlogs, gifts, and occasional funds for her enjoyment. These actions not only reflect your care but also aim to create opportunities for her to reach out and maintain a connection. Through brief phone calls and these gestures, you hope to bridge the distance, offering assurance of your constant support while encouraging her to feel comfortable sharing her challenges. Ultimately, you envision a relationship where her independence is balanced with the comfort of knowing she can lean on you whenever needed, fostering trust and openness over time.",
